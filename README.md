### Introduction
This project serves as a practical demonstration of web scraping, text analysis, and data processing using Python. It includes the following key components:
Web Scraping: Extracts textual content from a list of URLs.
Text Analysis: Computes various linguistic and sentiment analysis metrics on the extracted text.
Data Processing: Organizes the results and saves them in an Excel file.

### Features
Extracts article text from multiple URLs.
Performs text analysis, including sentiment analysis and linguistic metrics.
Calculates readability metrics like Flesch Reading Ease and FOG Index.
Provides a clear output structure in an Excel file for analysis and reporting.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up a Python environment with the required dependencies.
Prepare the input data (URLs and word lists) as specified in the instructions.
Run the Python script to perform web scraping and text analysis.
Review and analyze the results in the output Excel file.

### Usage
Here's a brief overview of how to use this project:

Environment Setup:

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Install the required Python libraries using pip.
Prepare Data:
Place the input Excel file (input.xlsx) and word lists (positive-words.txt and negative-words.txt) in the project directory.

Run the Script:
Execute the Python script to initiate web scraping and text analysis.

Results:
The results of text analysis will be saved in an Excel file named output_structure.xlsx.

### Dependencies
This project relies on several Python libraries for web scraping, text analysis, and data processing. The main dependencies include:
requests: For sending HTTP requests to URLs.
beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML content.
pandas: For data manipulation and saving results.
nltk: For sentiment analysis using the VADER lexicon.
textstat: For calculating readability and linguistic metrics.
Make sure to install these dependencies before running the script.
